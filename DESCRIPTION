Description: 
    DEGEmbedR enables hypothesis generation and statistical testing of gene 
    functions using dense vector representations (embeddings) derived from large 
    language models (LLMs). The package provides utilities to (i) compute or 
    import text/term embeddings (e.g., biological pathways or drug mechanisms 
    of action), (ii) generate function descriptions via LLMs, and 
    (iii) compare cosine-similarity distributions between differentially 
    expressed genes (DEGs) and background genes to quantify enrichment with 
    nonparametric tests and effect sizes. The framework supports curated 
    collections (GO BP, MSigDB C2 subcollections, MOA terms) as well as 
    user-supplied embeddings, facilitating hypothesis testing where predefined 
    gene sets are lacking and statistical assessment of novel LLM-inferred 
    functions.
