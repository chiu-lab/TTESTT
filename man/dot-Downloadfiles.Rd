\title{Download and store external data files for package use}
\usage{
.Downloadfiles(filename, url)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character. The name of the file to be saved under the
package's \code{data/} directory.}

\item{url}{Character. The full URL from which to download the file.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the destination file path where the data is saved.
If the download fails, the function returns \code{NULL} and prints a warning.
}
\description{
Internal helper function used to download required data files (e.g., pretrained
embeddings or similarity matrices) from a remote URL into the package's
\code{data/} directory. If the specified file already exists, no download occurs.
If the download fails, a warning is issued instead of stopping execution.
}
\details{
The function creates the \code{data/} directory inside the installed package path
(if it does not already exist), and saves the downloaded file there.

This function is primarily intended for internal use during package installation
or updates, when large external datasets (such as gene or pathway embeddings)
need to be retrieved automatically.

To make use of downloaded files at runtime, load them with \code{load()} or
\code{readRDS()} after confirming their presence via \code{system.file()}.
